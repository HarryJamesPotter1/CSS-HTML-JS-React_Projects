      This is a paragraph. You can notice there is a stylistic difference
      between a paragraph and headers
    </p>
    <p class="colorParagraph">
      What if you want a break in the paragraph like this <br />
      and not have it extend the whole page
    </p>
    <p class="goldParagraph">This is the break tag</p>

    <p class="colorParagraph">
      We can also use tags to bold and italicize text like this.
      <b>This text is in the bold tag so it is bolded.</b>
      <i> This text is in Italics</i>
    </p>

    <p class="goldParagraph">
      We can also use tags such as mark <mark>to highlight</mark> text. We can
      use the small tag <small>to make the text smaller</small>
    </p>

    <p class="colorParagraph">
      We can also format text in different ways. Let's see how we can do that.
    </p>

    <p class="goldParagraph">
      For example, we can format quotes <blockquote> Have never seen one who really loves
      goodness or one who really hates wickedness. One who really loves goodness
      will not place anything above it. One who really hates wickedness will
      practice goodness in such a way that wickedness will have no chance to get
      at him. Is there anyone who has devoted his whole strength to doing good
      for even as long as a single day? I have not seen anyone give up such an
      attempt because he had not the strength to go on. Perhaps there is such a
      case. But I have never seen it. - Confucis</blockquote>
    </p>

    <p class="colorParagraph">
      We can also format an address with the address tag.
